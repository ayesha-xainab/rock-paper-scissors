This is a simple implementation of the classic hand-game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" in C++. The game allows a user to play against the computer and keeps track of the user's score.

## Description

"Rock, Paper, Scissors" is usually played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible outcomes are:
